This javaagent repeats the logic of the combo-auth mod, but at the moment it only works on bangeeCord, and does not want to work on full-fledged servers yet.
But I'm not sure that **this** will be able to run on _your_ bangeeCord _(there are 2 places, if changed, it will not work)_
- [ ] full-fledged servers 
- [x] bangeeCord
- [ ] api for plugins / mods
